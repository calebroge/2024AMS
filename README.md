Overview of the 2024AMS (Asset Management System)

Developed this project during my senior year of college for the IT department. This system records asset information and tracks every asset that is assigned to a person within the system. 
In addition, this system can generate up-to-date reports on assets and barcodes with the press of a button. Attached is the documentation of the project below including the software requirements, database schema and input/output design.
