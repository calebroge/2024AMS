## Introduction

Developed this project during my senior year of college for the IT department. This system records asset information and tracks every asset that is assigned to a person within the system. 
In addition, this system can generate up-to-date reports on assets and barcodes with the press of a button. 

## Configuration

For the project to run on Visual Studio, make sure you change the database in the appsettings.json to the name of the computer machine you are using. 
In addition, you will need to download the database for this application in order for it to run and back it up on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
